BaseDamage=Property that allows the actor to remove an opposing actor from the map, but at the expense of its own health, taking in as much damage as the enemy had health. Most applicable for bases!
Damageable=This property allows the actor to apply damage to other actors in its radius, dealing a set amount of damage to itself in the process. Most applicable for projectiles!
MoveAlongAngle=This property allows the actor to move on a given angle until it has exhausted a radius distance, at which point it removes the actor for the map. This makes most sense when applied to projectiles!
MoveWithDestination=This property moves actors toward a given destination on the map. This is a good property for actors that have only a start and end point, such as troops!
MoveWithSetPath=This property gives an actor the paths that you drew on screen! The actor then moves along the path you drew until it reaches the end. This is a good property for troops!
ShootTargetFar=This property allows an actor to shoot projectiles toward an enemy actor in its radius, targeting only the enemy that is furthest away from the actor but still inside its radius. This is a useful property for towers!
ShootTargetNear=This property allows an actor to shoot projectiles toward an enemy actor in its radius, targeting only the enemy that is nearest to the actor but still inside its radius. This is a useful property for towers!
