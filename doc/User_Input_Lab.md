## Gideon's Comments

Naming for different upgradables is vague in authoring

right cick to end path is vague

clearing mid path authoring causes problems

The projectile editor is awkwar because you don;t ever spawn projectiles

Going to the next level changes path/background

Have level be more dependent on one another
